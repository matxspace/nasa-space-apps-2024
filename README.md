# nasa-space-apps-2024

Welcome! This is the homepage for the work of the Mat X Space team during the NASA Space Apps 2024 Hackathon!

This time, the project was [Seismic Detection Across the Solar System](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/challenges/seismic-detection-across-the-solar-system/).

Here are the resources that the team generated during the hackathon:
- [Python notebook](https://github.com/matxspace/nasa-space-apps-2024/blob/main/Seismic_Processing.ipynb): this is where we applied the [STA/LTA algorithm](https://gfzpublic.gfz-potsdam.de/rest/items/item_4097/component/file_4098/content) to the provided data.
